## Interesting Fact:
I attended Zu~Grama (https://zugrama.org/) in January-Feb 2025 and discussed the idea with an attendee Prof. M. V. Rajeev Gowda, a former Member of Parliament for Karnataka in the Rajya Sabha from 2014 to 2020 and a distinguished professor at IIM Bangalore from 2000 to 2014 (https://www.oneindia.com/politicians/prof.-m.-v.-rajeev-gowda-76817.html; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajeev_Gowda). He actually was interested, and himself proposed that "maybe not 100% of the amount, but say 5% can be allocated to projects of their choice". Before this I believed that this Tax~Direction could just be a good feedback system to tell the government regarding which decision to make (per year, through the budgets and policies); but actually allowing 5% of every person's tax amount to be allocated to the specific use case which the individual wants the government to solve (maybe a very specific problem) could be a gamechanger. Therefore, it is actually possible in leading democracies to pitch for a similar 5-10% Tax~Direction based Yearly Budgeting (yes, through this feedback every taxpayer will be able to affect each year's financial budget) and (unbiased) AI-enabled holistic policy development.. The government still retains the power to decide whether to implement the 5% or some percent rule; so this is just a sift control, but probably will be for the better than the worse...
